When this program is compiled and downloaded onto the UCFK4, a two player shooting game
is able to be played.

When "make program" is typed into the terminal (this directory), ther LED matrix on the 
funkit will display the message "CS0.16" which is the name of the game. If the navswitch 
is pushed down, then the game commences. Using NSEW on the navswitch you will be able to
control your "player" and shoot missiles using the navswitch push down.

Orienting two funkits so that their infrared transmitters and receivers are alligned, 
you will be able to play the two-player game. This means that the missile can travel onto
your opponents funkit. The aim of the game is to shoot your missile and hit your opponent 
on the other funkit. As time goes by, the rate and speed of the missile shots increase
which makes it more difficult to dodge.

If you eventually, get hit, you lose. The funkit lets you know about this by displaying the 
scrolling message "GGEZ". If you win, you will get the message "youwin!" If you wish to play
the game again, you and your opponent can push down on the navswitch.
